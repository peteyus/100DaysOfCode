# Day 11

Okay so a little bit of a cheat after a rough weekend. But to be fair, I'm going to be watching Unity videos after this. So it kind of evens out?

My solution was basically the highest rated solution. So yay for that? I just didn't use the ternary.

```c#
  public static int Triangular(int n)
  {
    return n < 0 ? 0 : n*(n+1)/2;
  }
```

Looks pretty similar. To be fair, I had to look up the formula, because after the fourth attempt at calculating it myself I was close but kept getting off after 5 or 6 iterations. 

Okay, I played with code, now on to videos. But not the same Packt one, since it skipped all the parts I care about in learning how to do this. Kinda wish there were a book to go with that one.

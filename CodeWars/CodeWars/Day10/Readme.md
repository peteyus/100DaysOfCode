# Day 10

Okay so this one is a bit of a cheat.

After one whose implemntation sounded like a fun challenge, but then the tests made absolutely zero sense as to how they expected me to develop it, and a second one where the instructions were intentionally vague (and in one case, a boldfaced lie) and the author was a total dick in the comments, I decided to go with an easy one so that I had SOME code to write.

I really liked the first one, the fluent calculator. I intentionally did not look at the solutions because I want to see if I can figure out how that one is done.

The second one, screw that guy. No developer who respects their own time would accept input that crappy with requirements that vague, and a client who treats his developers like that deserves both middle fingers.

The one I settled on (leap years) did teach me something though. I had no idea there was a `DateTime.IsLeapYear` method. So... there's that? 

I will say it was nice to be able to submit a one-line solution that I didn't even need to put into Visual Studio though.

Now I'm going to go watch a unity video for a while and try to drown out the sound of Darren sucking the spit out of his new braces.
